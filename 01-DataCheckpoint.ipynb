    "Malicious URLs are a major vector for phishing, malware delivery, and website defacement, and attackers increasingly embed harmful intent in the structure of a URL itself. These URLs often imitate legitimate sites, mislead users into entering sensitive information, or redirect them to compromised resources. Recent studies highlight their growing prevalence: Mittal (2023) notes that anti-phishing systems confronted over half a billion phishing attempts in 2022, underscoring the persistence and escalation of URL-based attacks.<a name=\"cite1\"></a><a href=\"#ref1\">1</a> Similarly, Omolara and Alawida (2025) report that malicious links rose by 144% in a single year, driven by techniques such as social engineering, obfuscation, and automated URL generation.<a name=\"cite2\"></a><a href=\"#ref2\">2</a> Collectively, this research shows that understanding URL characteristics is essential for mitigating harms associated with phishing and related threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional blacklist-based defenses, such as browser-integrated URL safety checks, were among the earliest strategies for blocking malicious links. However, blacklist systems fundamentally depend on previously identified threats. As Omolara and Alawida explain, attackers frequently rotate domain names, use URL shorteners, manipulate HTTP/HTTPS presentation, or rely on fast-flux hosting, techniques that allow newly created malicious URLs to evade blacklist detection long enough to cause damage.<a href=\"#ref2\">2</a> This limitation has motivated a shift toward automated, feature-based analysis that can evaluate a URL’s structure without requiring prior knowledge of whether it is malicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior work has analyzed the internal structure and lexical attributes of URLs to uncover which characteristics most reliably distinguish malicious links from benign ones. The literature identifies several strong predictors: the presence of an IP address instead of a domain name, abnormal anchor tags, unusually long URLs, excessive special characters, multi-subdomain patterns, and the use of misleading prefix/suffix tokens such as “-secure” or “-verify.” Mittal (2023) outlines dozens of such features, demonstrating how attributes like redirection counts, “@” symbols, URL entropy, and delimiter frequency can signal phishing activity.<a href=\"#ref1\">1</a> The recent survey by Tian et al. (2025) further categorizes these features into lexical, host-based, and content-based groups, emphasizing the predictive power of purely lexical features derived from characters, symbols, and token patterns within the URL string.<a name=\"cite3\"></a><a href=\"#ref3\">3</a> This aligns directly with our project’s focus on character-level URL analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to feature engineering research, many studies have evaluated machine learning models for malicious URL classification. Mittal (2023) demonstrates that interpretable “glass box” models such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees can achieve 90-95% accuracy using around 30 lexical and reputation-based features.<a href=\"#ref1\">1</a> More advanced approaches, such as the ensemble techniques evaluated in Omolara and Alawida’s DaE2 framework, reach up to 98% accuracy using boosting, bagging, and stacked models trained on large malicious-URL datasets.<a href=\"#ref2\">2</a> Tian et al. (2025) corroborate these findings, noting that character-level and token-level feature extraction remain among the strongest signals for ML-based URL detection.<a href=\"#ref3\">3</a> Together, this body of work establishes a strong foundation for predicting URL maliciousness using structural properties alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project builds directly on these findings by focusing specifically on correlations between URL characters, symbols, and structural patterns, and whether those characteristics can be used to distinguish malicious URLs (e.g., phishing, malware, defacement) from benign ones. While prior studies have explored broad sets of lexical and host-based features, fewer have isolated the predictive value of character-level traits such as symbol frequency, delimiters, suspicious token patterns, and URL length variations. By quantifying these relationships and applying predictive modeling, our study aims to evaluate how well these standalone URL characteristics can determine URL authenticity and contribute to early malicious-URL detection.\n",

    "### Dataset #1\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Dataset Name**: Malicious URLs dataset\n",
    "  - **Link to the dataset**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/malicious-urls-dataset\n",
    "  - **Number of observations**: 651,191 total URLs are included in the dataset.\n",
    "  - **Number of variables**: The dataset contains 2 main variables: URLS and type.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Description of the variables most relevant to this project:**\n",
    "    - **url:** (string):This is the web address itself \n",
    "    - **type:** (categorical label): This indicates what kind of URL it is: \n",
    "      - benign: legitimate URL\n",
    "      - defacement: website appearance has been altered\n",
    "      - phishing: designed to trick users into giving private info\n",
    "  malware: URL leads to harmful downloads\n",
    "  - **Descriptions of any shortcomings this dataset has with respect to the project**\n",
    "  - This dataset has a limited number of variables and no given numerical features which will make it difficult when attempting to train the model.\n",
    "  - This dataset consists of 66% \"benign\" URLs. This imbalance can make training models challenging because most models may simply learn to predict “benign” due to the skew in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset 2\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset Name:** URL-Phish: A Feature-Engineered Dataset for Phishing Detection\n",
    "- **Link to the dataset:** [https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/65z9twcx3r/1](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/65z9twcx3r/1)\n",
    "- **Number of observations:** The dataset contains 111,660 unique URLs\n",
    "- **Number of variables:** There are 26 total columns. This includes 22 numerical feature columns, 3 string reference columns (url, dom, tld), and 1 binary label column\n",
    "- **Description of the variables most relevant to this project:**\n",
    "    - **label:** The target variable, where 0 represents benign and 1 represents phishing\n",
    "    - **url_len:** The total length of the URL in characters, which has a mean of 32.95 but reaches a maximum of 1,202\n",
    "    - **entropy:** A measure of the randomness of characters in the URL, ranging from 2.65 to 6.03 bits\n",
    "    - **digit_ratio:** The proportion of numerical digits relative to the total URL length. Most samples have a low ratio (mean 0.013), but some reach as high as 0.826\n",
    "    - **is_https:** A binary flag (0 or 1) indicating if the URL uses a secure connection; approximately 43.1% of the dataset uses HTTPS\n",
    "- **Descriptions of any shortcomings this dataset has with respect to the project:**\n",
    "    - The dataset is heavily skewed, with phishing samples making up only 14.2% of the data compared to 85.8% for benign samples. This imbalance can cause models to be biased toward predicting \"benign\" by default\n",
    "    - There will be a sampling bias in Benign data, because Benign URLs were sourced exclusively from \"trusted sources\" such as educational (.edu), governmental (.gov), and top-ranked domains. This may not accurately represent the full diversity of legitimate URLs across the broader internet\n",
    "    - There are also temporal limitations because the phishing samples were collected between November 2024 and September 2025 and since phishing tactics change constantly, the features may not be as good predictors anymore on the legitimacy of a site\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plan to combine these datasets:** By combining Datasets 1 and 2, we hope to combat the limited feature set in Dataset 1 by incorporating the additional numerical variables recorded in Dataset 2. Both datasets contain a variable that identifies whether the URL is benign or malicious, so they will be standardized for a common binary format following Dataset 2’s structure where 0 represents benign and 1 represents malicious. To combine them, the numerical features in Dataset 2 will be engineered for Dataset 1 to have both datasets share the same column structure before being aligned. We will also remove duplicated URLs as necessary to avoid any bias."

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",

For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "\n",
    "                            Mix of Benign and Phishing URLS: Specified Characters, and Measures of Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThe most important metrics in this dataset to answer our research question include, the counts of different characters, the label, url length, entropy, seeing if it uses https, and digit ratio. Most of these different metrics are in integer form, specifically counts of different characters, seeing if it uses https, the label, and url length. The only ones which are different are entropy and digit ratio, which are both floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the counts of different characters, there are no specific unit types involved, only different numbers quantifying how many characters there are in a specific URL. For example, if a URL is “yay12_” then the character count of _ would go up by one. This will be beneficial to see if different characters influence whether or not a URL is benign or phishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the label, there are no specific unit types involved either. The values for label are either 0 or one. The section label is essentially just letting the person reading the dataset know if a specific URL is benign or phishing, with a 0 or one representing each respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the URL length, this is again not using any specific unit types, just ranging numbers, quantifying how many characters make up any given URL. For instance if a URL is “fake_url” then the URL length would have the number 8, the number of characters in a URL. This will be helpful to see if benign URLS are shorter or longer on average than phishing URLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy talks about how random any given character is in a URL. This is essentially talking about the average of randomness in a URL in our specific dataset. This is measured by a float, and can range in value if a URL is more random than another. This is so we can see if benign URLS are more or less random than phishing URLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digit ratio in this dataset is how many numbers a specific URL has compared to other characters in it. This is a float, or decimal, that can have quite a range in value depending on the different URL being looked at. This will allow us to look and see if benign URLS use more numbers on average than a phishing URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, seeing if a URL uses HTTPS or not. This will either be a value of 0 or one, which shows that a specific URL is using HTTPS(0) or not(1). This will allow us to see if HTTPS has any impact on the legitimacy of a URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThe major concern with this dataset is the fact that it is mostly made up of benign URLS. This dataset being made up of mostly benign URLS, makes it so we will have less overall data on malicious URLS. This means the model our group ends up making in the end, will be quite good at predicting if a URL is benign, but could be less adept at pinpointing if the URL we give it is specifically phishing. The other part of our research question, seeing if a URL is malware, or its purpose is defacement, will also not be able to be answered specifically with this dataset. To answer that, the model will require the usage of the other set to fill in the blind spot this dataset has. This set is also a bit old for looking into how to best predict a phishing URL, which could cause it to work better on URLS from the timeframe the ones in the dataset are collected from. This makes it so as time goes on, the model will become less and less accurate with predicting whether or not a URL is benign or phishing, unless accurate, and up to date data is given to the model, so it can continue learning. These are specific issues of the dataset to consider, as we attempt to answer our research question.\n"

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Most of the datasets we are currently looking at are publicly available datasets, so the people whose URL's are included have not consented for their data to be used in our specific project.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The datasets we are looking at currently were published between 1 to 5 years ago, so we have temporal bias (unless we find more recent datasets to pull from), since if we train our model on older data it may fail to recognize more recent/modern threats or patterns because it would prioritize looking for characteristsics that are outgrown/outdated.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, our project specifically needs to focus on this ethical concern because URL's can frequently contain PII like emails or user IDs. We'd need to consider anonymizing these URL's or stripping these types of parameters to avoid exposing any user data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We've considered that malicious URLs may be more frequently associated with certain regions or languages, and that theres a possibility our model could unfairly flag benign sites if they have structural similarities with known malicious domains, which is something we should try to minimize if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, we realize that storing a large database of malicious URLs could be a security risk if its accessed by people with intentions to study existing malware or learn from it and cause more attacks, so we plan to keep the data secured within the repo and datahub.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We've considered this yes, but at the same time since we are using third-party datasets we dont really have a way to remove someone's URL upon request. We don't know if there is a work around for this ethical concern in our project's case.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, we will delete the data once we finish the project and the quarter ends\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, we think one main blindspot is that we arent cybersecurity experts, so there is a lot of perspective that we would lack when it comes to understaning certain aspects of phishing. The main thing we could attempt to do to fix this is by researching/learning more about it before we start.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We talked about how the model may develop a confirmatio bias if the training data is imbalanced, like for example if we use more malware URLs to train it than defacement URLs. So the steps we'd need to take to mitigate these possible biases is to make sure the model doesnt just \"learn\" to guess the most common class.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, our goal for our representations will be that they clearly define what makes up a malicious URL as best as we can and as clearly as we can to avoid misleading audiences in any way.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We have considered this, and we will ensure that raw URLs containing any PII are not displayed in sny representations nor the final report.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, all of our process will be documented in Jupyter Notebooks and pushed to our GitHub repo to make sure the results are reproducible and accessible if we discover any issues in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, we acknowledge this, and we will research the variables thoroughly enough to ensure they aren't acting as proxies for discrimination against legitimate websites.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will thoroughly test for disparate error rates, e.g. if the model is way more accurate for \".com\" domains and way less accurate for \".org\" domains then the model is not fair, and we will either try to address this bias or address that failure in the final report.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We've set a goal of 90% accuracy, but we also realize the cost of false positives (blocking a benign site) versus false negatives (letting malware pass through undetected), since a model with 90% accuracy that blocks 10% of safe sites across the world would be a big problem realistically.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes we can, we can be transparent with our features and highlight which one triggered the URL to be marked as malicious, and based on that we can provide a technical justification in understandable terms.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, in the final report and in any other documentations where its important to mention the shortcomings, we will make it clear that it is a class project and not a legitimate security tool in any way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> No, we do not have a long-term deployment plan after the final project is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, we would need a plan for when our model wrongly labels legitimate sites as malicious, and we discussed ways which we could go about this, like for example proactively updating the model as the digital landscape changes or if we see a way to improve the model to avoid harmful results. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, we agreed our model should have a defined mechanism to turn off or roll back the model if it starts to cause unindended harm or very incorrect results.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, as mentioned before, we realize that if the model is used in a negative way to study the algorithm, or use it to test someone's malicious URLs so that they could maybe bypass our 90% accuracy, that our project could potentially become a tool to create better scams. So we acknowledge that if this were to be deployed we would need some sort of monitoring plan to prevent such actions."
